This is my first golang project which I am making so that I can learn. The UI is not finished, the backend is finished but isn't using environment variables and I still need to add auth middleware for the API routes, and maybe a rate limiter. The JWT secret is just "secret". Im using SASS just so that I can embed CSS classes. I know there is a way to do that natively with CSS now but I couldn't get it to work for some reason.
