# Go-Chat

## This is my first golang project, its a chat app that uses MongoDB and Websockets.

## It is also mostly broken - the server crashes when you refresh and sometimes messages are not received.........

Features :

- Refresh tokens
- Customizable profiles
- Customizable rooms
- Custom Rate limiter
- Group chat
- Customizable profiles
- Automatic account deletion
- Automatic clean up via changestream
